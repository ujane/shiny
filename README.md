im super tired of installing the same things over and over on new boxes
(kind of especially new ubuntu machines). once the things i need get
installed, life progresses about as i expect it to.

this package contains all those things. i will probably update it with
more packages and things if i get around to it, but don't go expecting great
things of this package or its author, k?
